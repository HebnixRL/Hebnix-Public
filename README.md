## Access to our Rank API data

2.2.0 will include an additional method of authentication in accessing our Rank API. Although Hebnix will compile without the key, you will require a key to access it.
You can get a key by requesting one on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/yr6xXb5wQd) and it will be DMed to you. Open a request in the requests channel.

## Build

Install Rust with the MSVC toolchain, then run:

    cd hebnix_rs
    cargo build --release

Build the optional bridge executable with `rlapi_bridge/build.bat`.

Set `$env:HEBNIX_BASE_DIR` to use a different data directory while developing.

There is also a more user friendly build.bat file.

## Packaging

    cd hebnix_rs
    ./package.ps1

## Plugins and themes
