<#
build release + assemble a clean dist/ with only what ships. nothing from
target/ (no deps/, build/, .ilk, .d...).

dist/ =
  hebnix.exe
  hebnix-lite.exe

Support programs are embedded in both executables and extracted under
%AppData%\Hebnix at runtime.

pdb (target/release/hebnix.pdb, big) is not shipped by default. keep it
archived per release so you can symbolicate a user's crash.txt later. -WithPdb
bundles it in dist/ instead (readable crashes on their machine, way bigger dl).
